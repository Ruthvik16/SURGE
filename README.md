# SURGE
This Repository Contains Codes and Experimentation of my SURGE Project.
In the SURGE folder, the code for sudoko solving, generation and the chromatic number problem is in the sudoko_1 file
The experimentation of the 2 quibit toy implementation, is included in the encoding & encoding-1 files, while the final implementation is in the encoding-2 notebook
A small experimentation of qiskit simulations is in the quantum_test file
A relatively complex circuit using multiple gates simulated with Qiskit is in the quantum_test file
